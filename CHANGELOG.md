# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.27.0] - 2026-08-16
### Added
- **You can now rename a bookmark's title.** Highlight it in `ps`, press <kbd>→</kbd>
  and pick *Rename Pinboard Title*. There was previously no way to do this at all — the
  `rename` command only ever handled tags.
  - Pinboard has no edit endpoint, so this is a read-modify-write: the bookmark is
    looked up, then re-posted to the same URL with `replace: yes`. Tags, notes, privacy
    and the read-later flag are carried across explicitly, because anything not carried
    would be erased. If the URL isn't in the local cache the rename is refused rather
    than silently creating a new, empty bookmark.
  - Also available as `pinion retitle --url <URL> <new title…>`.

### Fixed
- *Rename Pinboard Tag* no longer misfires on bookmarks. It accepts text, and a URL is
  text, so Alfred offered it on any search result and then fed the URL in as a tag
  name — which failed silently, because Pinboard reports success for renaming a tag
  that does not exist. Input that looks like a URL is now rejected with a note pointing
  at *Rename Pinboard Title*.

## [0.26.0] - 2026-08-16
### Added
- **Posting a bookmark is now silent unless it fails.** It previously fired *two*
  notifications every time — "Posted: <title>" and then "Updated cache files!" — which
  was enough of an irritation to make notifications worth switching off entirely,
  hiding the failures that actually matter. A new **Notify on successful post**
  checkbox in the workflow's configuration restores the old behaviour; it is off by
  default. Failures notify regardless of the setting.

### Fixed
- The self-update cleanup still deleted `latest_release_Rusty_Pin.alfredworkflow`, a
  filename left behind by the rename, so stale downloads accumulated in the cache
  directory instead of being removed.

## [0.25.1] - 2026-08-16
### Fixed
- `pa` now confirms straight away that the token was saved. The
  "Successfully set user credentials" message is consumed by a conditional purely as a
  routing signal, so the only notification came *after* the full bookmark download had
  finished — a long silent gap that reads as though nothing happened. A notification now
  fires the moment the token reaches the Keychain, in parallel with the download rather
  than delaying it.

## [0.25.0] - 2026-08-16
### Added
- **The binary is now signed with a Developer ID and notarised by Apple.** Without it,
  a downloaded workflow is quarantined and macOS kills the binary on first use with
  "Apple could not verify … is free of malware", offering *Move to Bin* as the default
  button. Verified both ways: an ad-hoc signed binary is `rejected` by `spctl` and
  blocked on execution, while the same binary signed and notarised is
  `accepted — source=Notarized Developer ID` and runs silently.
  - There is deliberately no `stapler staple` step: stapling only works on
    `.app`/`.dmg`/`.pkg` bundles and fails with error 73 on a loose executable. It is
    not needed, because Gatekeeper resolves the ticket with Apple online. The only
    residual case is a user who is offline the very first time they use the workflow.
  - Releases built without the signing secrets still succeed, with a warning, so forks
    and pull requests are unaffected.

### Changed
- Hardened the release pipeline, since it now holds a signing certificate:
  - Every GitHub Action is pinned to an immutable commit SHA rather than a moving
    tag. A tag can be repointed at new code — that is exactly how the
    `tj-actions/changed-files` compromise worked — and an action in this workflow runs
    on the same runner as the unlocked signing keychain.
  - Permissions are least-privilege per job. The default is now `contents: read`, and
    only the release job gets `contents: write`. The build job, the one that holds the
    certificate, can no longer write to the repository.
  - Both the notary key and the signing keychain are destroyed in an `always()` step
    that runs before the third-party upload and release actions.
- The workflow's *Created by* field is now just "Victor Rodrigues". The previous
  "(originally by Hamid R. Ghadyani)" was truncated in Alfred's UI; the attribution
  lives in the README and on the repository instead.

## [0.24.1] - 2026-08-16
### Fixed
- The 0.24.0 release bundle contained a stale 4.4 MB binary and a nested 3.1 MB copy of
  an older `.alfredworkflow`. Renaming the project changed the `.gitignore` patterns that
  had been keeping those two build artefacts untracked, so they were committed and then
  legitimately packaged. They are removed, the ignore rules now cover every name the
  binary has had, and the packaging step fails outright if it finds a nested bundle or
  any executable other than `pinion`.

## [0.24.0] - 2026-08-16
### Changed
- **The workflow is now called Pinion.** A pinion is the small gear that drives a larger
  one; *to pinion* is to bind something so it cannot get away; and it is the outer set of
  feathers on a bird's wing. It also contains *pin*. It was *Rusty Pin* upstream.
- **New bundle id: `com.victorrodrigues.pinion`**, replacing `cc.hamid.alfred-pinboard-rs`.
  This is normally something to avoid — Alfred keys a workflow's data, cache and settings
  off the bundle id, so changing it orphans all three and registers a second copy. It is
  done here only because there are no installs to preserve. **Anyone running an older
  version should delete it from Alfred before installing this one**, then re-run `pa`;
  the Keychain entry is keyed off the bundle id too.
- The binary, crate and release asset are renamed to match: `pinion` and
  `Pinion.alfredworkflow`. The permanent download link is now
  `releases/latest/download/Pinion.alfredworkflow`.
- The repository moved to `vmlrodrigues/pinion`. GitHub redirects the old URL, but the
  self-updater points at the new one directly.
- The debug log target followed the crate rename to `pinion`, so Alfred's debug panel
  keeps showing output.

## [0.23.0] - 2026-08-16
### Security
- **The Pinboard API token now lives in the macOS Keychain**, not in plaintext in
  `settings.json`. It is moved across automatically the first time you use the workflow
  after upgrading, and the plaintext copy is deleted. The token is deliberately *not* in
  Alfred's configuration panel: values there are carried along when a workflow is
  exported or synced.
- `redact_token` no longer deletes surrounding text, and no longer leaks. It scanned to
  the next `&`, `)` or space and dropped everything in between, so a newline or `", `
  after the token swallowed the following words of the error message. It now consumes
  exactly the token and is case-insensitive.

### Fixed
- Typing a tag query containing non-breaking or thin spaces no longer discards the tags
  already typed. The panic fix in 0.18.0 sliced to the *start* byte of a multi-byte
  separator, so the slice failed and every earlier tag was silently dropped — a bookmark
  could be posted with only the last tag.
- <kbd>⌘⏎</kbd> on a bookmark with no tags no longer overwrites the clipboard with an
  empty string.
- **Firefox Developer Edition is detected again**, and can no longer bookmark the wrong
  page. It was guarded by `appIsRunning("Firefox")` while the process is named after the
  bundle; worse, with both Firefox editions running the guard passed but an inner check
  failed, and the script then returned whatever happened to be on the clipboard as the
  URL. The clipboard read is now inside the guard in both Firefox branches, so a miss
  fails visibly instead of inventing a URL.
- Settings you changed in the configuration panel before your first run after upgrading
  are no longer overwritten by the migration.
- A malformed token now shows an error in Alfred instead of an empty window.
- A failed popular-tags fetch no longer leaves the previous page's suggestions in the
  cache, where the next keystroke would offer them for a different URL.
- Failures while writing the configuration sheet are reported as what they are, instead
  of "Corrupted config file. Set API token again!".

### Changed
- New workflow icon.
- README rewritten without screenshots. Functionality is shown as the commands you
  actually type, with reference tables for keywords, modifiers and settings. Screenshots
  went stale faster than they earned their place; `res/images/` (10 MB) is deleted.

## [0.22.0] - 2026-08-16
### Security
- **The dependency tree is now free of known advisories.** `atty`
  (RUSTSEC-2021-0145, RUSTSEC-2024-0375) and `time` 0.1 (RUSTSEC-2020-0071, a
  segfault) are both gone, joining `structopt` and `ansi_term` which went in 0.21.0.
  `atty` arrived via `env_logger` 0.9 in two dependencies that were outside this
  project's control until now; `time` 0.1 came from `chrono`'s default `oldtime`
  feature and went with a bump to chrono 0.4.45.

### Changed
- **`rusty-pin` and `alfred-rs` are now vendored under `vendor/`** instead of being
  fetched from git and crates.io. Both are unmaintained upstream. `rusty-pin` was the
  project's biggest fragility: it is not on crates.io, has no other fork, and its
  `master` is API-incompatible with this code, so any `cargo update` or a lost
  `Cargo.lock` broke the build outright — and if that repository were renamed or
  deleted, the build would simply stop working. There is now no git dependency and no
  revision to pin. See [vendor/README.md](vendor/README.md) for provenance, licences
  and the local changes.
- Lint and format steps are scoped to this package rather than `--all`/`--workspace`,
  so the vendored crates are not held to this project's formatting and lint rules.
- README refreshed: the fork summary, the search modifiers, the settings description
  and the browser list were all out of date, and there is now a section on building
  from source.

## [0.21.0] - 2026-08-16
### Changed
- Replaced `structopt` with `clap` 4. `structopt` has been in maintenance mode since
  2022 (RUSTSEC-2022-0104) and pinned the tree to `clap` 2. Every flag, short, long,
  default and conflict is unchanged — the command-line surface was diffed
  subcommand-by-subcommand before and after, and all 18 invocations the workflow
  actually makes were replayed against the new binary.

### Security
- Dropped `structopt` (RUSTSEC-2022-0104) and `ansi_term` (RUSTSEC-2021-0139) from the
  dependency tree, along with `clap` 2, `textwrap`, `vec_map` and `proc-macro-error`.
- `atty` (RUSTSEC-2021-0145, RUSTSEC-2024-0375) is **not** yet gone. It no longer
  arrives through `structopt`, but `alfred-rs` 0.7.1 still depends on `env_logger` 0.9,
  which depends on it. Removing it needs a change in `alfred-rs`, which is published on
  crates.io by the original author and is not something this fork controls.

## [0.20.0] - 2026-08-16
### Added
- <kbd>⌘⏎</kbd> in search results copies whichever of the tags or URL is currently
  shown under <kbd>⌘</kbd>, and <kbd>⌃⏎</kbd> copies the bookmark's extended note.
  Both modifiers previously changed the subtitle but left <kbd>⏎</kbd> doing the same
  thing as no modifier at all, so two bindings did nothing. Nothing was taken away:
  <kbd>⌥⏎</kbd> and <kbd>⌘⌥⏎</kbd> behave exactly as before.
- A bookmark with no extended note marks the <kbd>⌃</kbd> alternate invalid, so
  <kbd>⌃⏎</kbd> does nothing instead of copying an empty string.

### Fixed
- The <kbd>⌃</kbd> alternate declared an `arg` that nothing consumed, because no
  connection carried the Control modifier. It now feeds the clipboard.
- Alfred's <kbd>⌥</kbd> route had no modifier subtext, so nothing hinted the modifier
  existed. All modifier routes out of `ps` are now labelled.

## [0.19.1] - 2026-08-16
### Fixed
- The "show URLs / show tags in search results" checkbox added in 0.19.0 was labelled
  backwards. The stored flag is named `show_url_vs_tags`, but `true` actually means
  *show tags* — so the checkbox is now labelled "Show tags in results" and matches
  what it does. Behaviour is unchanged; only the label was wrong.
- Corrected "Post all new bookmarksas as public" in the `pset shared` list.

### Changed
- The eight `pset` pickers now emit Alfred's JSON format instead of the Alfred 2-era
  XML they had used since 2018. That format is long deprecated and structurally could
  not carry modifier alternates, variables or typed icons, so this unblocks those.
  Every title, subtitle, icon and argument is unchanged.
- Those pickers no longer set `uid`, so the two choices always appear in the same
  order. Previously Alfred reordered them by how often each was picked, which makes a
  two-item toggle move under the cursor. The old values were inconsistent anyway
  (`1`/`2`, `1`/`10`, empty, and in one case the leftovers `tagonly`/`des`).
- Dropped the `autocomplete` values from those pickers. They were copy-paste noise
  ("Yes"/"No") and tab-completing a toggle to the literal text "Yes" served no purpose.

## [0.19.0] - 2026-08-16
### Added
- Settings now appear in Alfred's native **workflow configuration** panel: eight
  checkboxes and two number fields, instead of being reachable only through keywords.
  The configuration sheet is the source of truth and is passed to the workflow as
  environment variables.

### Changed
- The `pset` keywords all still work and are unchanged from a user's point of view, but
  they now write into Alfred's configuration sheet rather than into the workflow's own
  `settings.json`.
- On the first run after upgrading, existing preferences are copied from `settings.json`
  into the configuration sheet automatically. Without this an upgrade would have reset
  everyone's settings to the workflow defaults, since the sheet starts out empty.
  A value that Alfred does not supply, or that cannot be parsed, leaves the stored
  setting untouched rather than falling back to a default.
- The Pinboard API token deliberately does **not** move into the configuration sheet.
  It stays in `settings.json`, out of anything that gets exported or synced with the
  workflow.

## [0.18.2] - 2026-08-16
### Fixed
- Opera Developer and Opera Beta are detected again. Both branches were dead, for two
  independent reasons: `Opera Beta` was matched against the string `"Opera Beta.pp"`,
  missing the `a` in `.app`, and both branches asked `appIsRunning("Opera")` while the
  running processes are named `Opera Developer` and `Opera Beta`. AppleScript's list
  `contains` is exact membership rather than a substring test, so neither could ever
  match. Regular Opera was unaffected.

## [0.18.1] - 2026-08-16
### Fixed
- Helium now uses its native AppleScript dictionary (`net.imput.helium`) instead of
  reading the accessibility tree. Helium is a Chromium fork and answers the same
  `active tab of first window` as Chrome, so the previous approach was not only more
  fragile but unnecessary. It required an Accessibility permission that macOS never
  prompts for — without it Helium silently never worked, because the surrounding
  `try` swallowed the permission error — and it returned the browser *window* title
  rather than the tab title, so bookmarks saved from Helium had worse titles than
  those from any other browser.

## [0.18.0] - 2026-08-16
This is the first release from the maintained fork at
[vmlrodrigues/alfred-pinboard-rs](https://github.com/vmlrodrigues/pinion).

### Security
- The Pinboard API token is no longer printed into Alfred's debug window. It is passed as
  a token type whose `Debug` implementation redacts it, so it cannot leak by accident again.
- The API token can no longer reach the UI, logs, or disk through error messages. The
  token travels as a URL query parameter and network errors quote the full URL, so all
  error text is now redacted before it is displayed, logged, or cached.
- A failed popular-tags fetch is no longer stored as a bookmark tag. The error was written
  to the tag cache and shown as a selectable Alfred row.

### Fixed
- Self-update now targets this fork. It previously polled the upstream repository, so an
  upstream release would have replaced this workflow with theirs.
- No longer panics when a query contains non-ASCII whitespace, such as the non-breaking
  space you get when pasting from a web page.
- No longer panics when listing tags on an account that has no tags.
- A configuration save that fails now exits non-zero instead of reporting success.
- `pu` / `pupdate` now forces a full download, so a corrupt cache can actually be rebuilt.

### Changed
- `rusty-pin` is now sourced from a fork and pinned by revision, so `cargo update` can no
  longer break the build or silently pull in unreviewed upstream changes.
- Release bundles are built from the files git tracks rather than a blanket copy, dropping
  about 532 KB of orphaned images and stray files that shipped in every previous release.
- The release asset is now named `AlfredPinboardRust.alfredworkflow` without the version,
  making `releases/latest/download/…` a permanent link.
- Workflow identity (`createdby`, `webaddress`, in-Alfred readme) now points at this fork.
  The `bundleid` is deliberately unchanged so existing installs keep their cache and token.
- Rewrote the README, added a download button, and added Dependabot for CI and crates.

### Removed
- Deleted dead CI: `appveyor.yml`, `disable-travis`, `ci/`, `.circleci-disabled/`.
- Deleted `res/workflow/foo.txt` and the unused `identify-browser.applescript`.
- Removed `FUNDING.yml`, which pointed sponsorship at the original author's account.

## [0.17.2] - 2026-06-29
### Added
- Add support for Helium browser in active tab detection.
### Changed
